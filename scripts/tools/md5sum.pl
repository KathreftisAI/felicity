=head1 NAME

md5sum.pl - output the md5sum of a file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

perl md5sum.pl [filename]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program will generate an MD5sum of a file and display it.
Although this trivial task is generally performed by the B<md5sum>
builtin on many systems, not all platforms (Windows!) have this.
In that case using this script is a nice alternative.
